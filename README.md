**RESEARCH QUESTION**

These projects required us to implement a K-nearest neighbor (kNN) classifier  and a Naive Bayes classifier on two different datasets.

**METRICS FOR SUCCESS**

Create predictive models with a 70% prediction accuracy.

**EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN**

Import the relevant libraries that we will use in our analysis.

Import the datasets and check the data.

Find and deal with outliers and missing data within the dataset.

Perform univariate and bivariate analysis while recording our observations.

Implement the solution by using the KNN classifier algorithm to predict whether a passenger survived in the Titanic crash considering the 80-20, 70-30 and 60-40 test size split.

Implement the solution by using the Naives Bayes to predict whether an email is spam or not considering the 80-20, 70-30 and 60-40 test size split.

Challenge the solution by giving insights on how we can optimize the model to give us a better performance
